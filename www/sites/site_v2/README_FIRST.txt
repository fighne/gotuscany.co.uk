Web site publishing information for Linux
-----------------------------------------

You should upload your Web site files to the "www" folder.  Files not in that folder may not be accessible from the Internet.

The main page of your Web site will normally be called "index.html" but may be called "index.php", "index.asp" or similar instead depending on the content/type of the file.  This filename must be in lowercase.

CGI (executable) files/scripts should be uploaded to the "cgi-bin" folder.
